Global EngAGE
============

Global EngAGE is an interdisciplinary team of computer engineers, business administration students and ageing services experts that was born within the [LeadingAge Hackfest 2013](leadingagehackfest.org), and won the competition with the **EngAGE** system idea. 

EngAGE is about giving homebound elders the opportunity of participating in activities that are organized by retirement communities or senior centers, through an easy to use videoconference application where they can not only see what's going on, but also interact directly with the people who is on the site.
